# Contributor guidelines

Looking to contribute? Great! We work on a Pull Request basis, but if you're unfamiliar with Github and spotted a mistake, please feel free to [e-mail](mailto:info@libscie.org) your contribution. Being familiar with Github is not a prerequisite to contribute (if you want to learn go [here](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)). If you feel that your contribution is rejected for improper reasons, please contact [Achintya Rao](mailto:achintya@achintyarao.in), who will try to resolve the issue with the maintainers.

Specific contributions are greatly appreciated. We try to keep our [issues page](https://github.com/libscie/liberator/issues) up-to-date so you can find specific tasks that can be completed there. Feel free to pick and choose what you feel you can contribute to! 

At the moment, we can really use Django-skilled developers, database engineers (PostgreSQL) and deployment specialists (we want to deploy to Heroku). 

General, non-specific contributions that are always appreciated (not exhaustive :godmode:):

1. code reviews
	* we all make mistakes, and so do we. Notice a mistake, no matter how small? Suggest a change.
2. ideas
	* we don't pretend to know all the answers, we just try to work towards them. See us go in a wrong direction? Stop us by providing us with your constructive insight. Submit a Github issue on the relevant project, or [e-mail us](mailto:info@libscie.org).
3. text translation
	* we prefer to have text available to everyone in their native language, because this makes it much easier to understand the content. Any contributions for translations are greatly appreciated, but are limited to Pull Requests initially due to the amount of work. 
	* but if you don't feel confident about translating and would prefer us to provide our content in your language, [e-mail us](mailto:info@libscie.org) and we'll keep a vote count. Each time a language gets 100 votes and we cannot find a contributor to translate, we'll actually hire an official translator. A digital vote count check might be something we make sooner rather than later.
	* we commit to maintaining up-to-date translations for new pages once a translation for a project has been added.
